Aim: To study and implement Operators in C++.

Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz online compiler

Theory:

The first program asks the user to enter an integer and then checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. It uses conditional statements like if, else if, and else to decide the result. If the number is greater than zero, it prints "Number is POSITIVE." If the number is less than zero, it prints "Number is NEGATIVE." And if the number is exactly zero, it prints "Number is ZERO."

The second program accepts marks for five subjects: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English. It calculates the average of these marks and assigns a grade based on that average. The program uses if-else conditions to decide the grade. For example, if the average is between 90 and 100, it assigns an ‘O’ grade; if it is between 80 and 89, it assigns ‘A+’, and so on. If the average falls outside the valid range of 0 to 100, the program shows an error message asking the user to enter valid marks.

The third program determines the position of a point in a 2D coordinate system. It takes two inputs from the user: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. Then, using if-else statements, it figures out where the point lies — whether it is in the first, second, third, or fourth quadrant, or exactly on the x-axis or y-axis, or at the origin where both coordinates are zero. The program then prints the point’s position accordingly.

In all these programs, logical and relational operators were used to compare values, and decision-making statements helped the program choose the correct output based on the conditions.

Conclusion:
Hence, we used logical and relational operators along with decision-making statements to write programs that give accurate results based on user input.
